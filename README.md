In this repository I am posting solutions for "Advent of Code 2022".

Structure of the repository:
- each folder named dayN contains test.txt, input.txt and solution.py
- test.txt is (one of the) example(s) given in the task description that has a correct answer in the text of the task;
- input.txt is a competition input, added to gitignore
- solution.py is a python file that icludes fuction reading input, parsing it and producing a solution.

Notes and to-dos:
- day14/part2 solution is very far from ideal and runs over 15 min - the first candidate for future optimization.
